# *Data and Results Visualization* final project

Project realized for the course *Data and Results Visualization* at *Politecnico di Milano*. 
 
 The goal of the project is to analyze complex networks  built using the [Barabasi-Albert algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model), based on the preferential attachment mechanism.

Implementation realized with *Python Jupyther*, by using [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) and [igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) Python modules to manage and plot the generated networks.

 - [dataViz_project_final](https://github.com/denaldo98/data-visualization-of-Complex-Networks/blob/main/dataViz_project_final.ipynb) is the notebook with the actual code, containing all the detailed steps of the performed analysis
 - [BA_net.net](https://github.com/denaldo98/data-visualization-of-Complex-Networks/blob/main/BA_net.net) is the file of the network generated using the Barabasi algorithm
 - [USairport500.txt](USairport500.txt) is a real-world network (taken from [opsahl.co.uk](http://opsahl.co.uk/tnet/datasets/USairport500.txt) ) used in the notebook
